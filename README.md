# OmniSight: The Probability Layer of the Internet

> **Markets aren't for gambling. They're for discovery.**

OmniSight is a next‑generation decentralized forecasting and truth‑discovery protocol. We turn beliefs into liquid markets, capital into conviction, and accuracy into a permanent reputation graph.

---

## 🚀 The Vision

We are building the infrastructure for machine‑readable truth. In a world of noise, OmniSight provides the signal. Our protocol allows users to weight their conviction with capital, rewarding those who are correct and creating a real-time probability layer for crypto, AI, and global events.

## 🛠 For Builders
**The Truth is Composable.** OmniSight is built from the ground up to be the foundation for your next project.

- **Forecast‑as‑a‑Service API**: Integrate real-time probabilities, confidence bands, and momentum shifts directly into your dApps or AI agents.
- **Market Templates**: Safely scale permissionless market creation with DAO-governed resolution logic and edge-case handling.
- **DeFi-Native**: Multi-oracle consensus (Chainlink, Optimistic, Human Jurors) and LP vaults for category-based exposure.
- **Account Abstraction**: Seamless user onboarding with social logins and gasless transactions.

## 📈 For Users
**Your Edge is Your Asset.** Participation isn't about PnL; it's about being right.

- **Reputation Graphs**: Build a permanent, on-chain record of your forecasting accuracy across domains like Crypto, Politics, and Tech.
- **Truth Discovery**: Access high-fidelity signals on protocol upgrades, exploit risks, and macro trends before they hit the mainstream.
- **Execute & Analyze**: High-performance trading UI with technical HUD aesthetics for a premium, instrument-panel feel.
